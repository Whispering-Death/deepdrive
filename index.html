He is passionate about his life and the high level of energy rubs off onto people who interact with him. I do not play golf yet , and hope to do so in the future when time permits under Vasu’s guidance.

His Golf principles help me in day to day problem solving and look at situations in a different context . One of the keys to Vasu’s personality,is we can work together without any expectations and be who we are without conflict. I look forward to many more years of association and friendship. ”</p>

                                <p class="minimize">“ I met Vasu at a time when I was very uncertain with my life. The previous 2 years had not gone according to my plans and I had to make important decisions about the future ahead. I was also lacking confidence in myself which made me doubt my decision making abilities. With his guidance, I took the right path which has led to success both professionally and personally.

From the moment I met Vasu, I knew he was someone different. In fact, I think most people have this experience because it's clearly apparent from his body language to his manner of speaking that he's no ordinary person. Unlike others who parrot platitudes, he has opinions that he can back with sound reasoning. This is why his advice is so meaningful. He is also a terrific communicator and the best I've ever met. As Einstein put it, "if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough". Vasu's ability to break complex thoughts into digestible bits that are simple to put into action sets him a league apart. Anyone who's met him for more than 5 minutes knows the kind of infectious confidence he has. This makes it great to be around him because he will always elevate your mood. However, in my opinion, Vasu's greatest strength is his ability to empathize. Whether you're moving up in life or falling down the abyss, he will "get you" and that will reassure you that you're not alone in this journey. 

I've known Vasu for 8 years and I consider him to be my mentor. I was fortunate to meet him when I did and I am even more fortunate that he chose to stay in touch with me after all these years. He has introduced me to some amazing people which is another great benefit of knowing him but it's his guidance that has made a huge impact on my life. I can say with fullest of conviction that I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for him and if you do get the chance of meeting him then thank your lucky stars. ”</p>

He is an ardent devotee of the great Indian sage Sri Ramana Maharshi and has published books, including, “Happiness and the Art of Being”, “The Practice of Self Enquiry” ,“Practising Who Am I” and “Life Beyond Death”. He was also profoundly influenced by the teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and William Samuel. </p>
